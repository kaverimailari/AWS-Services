What is AWS Lambda?

AWS Lambda is a serverless compute service that lets you run code without provisioning or managing servers.

 You upload your function → AWS handles:
✔ Infrastructure
 ✔ Scaling
 ✔ High availability
 ✔ Patching
 ✔ Capacity planning

You only pay for execution time, measured in milliseconds.

Lambda can be triggered by over 200+ AWS events (S3 uploads, API calls, EventBridge, SNS, DynamoDB streams, CloudWatch events, etc.), making it perfect for automation.

⚙️ Why DevOps & Cloud Engineers Use Lambda

Lambda is extremely useful in areas where you need automation, event-driven workflows, or lightweight backend logic.

Here are the strongest use cases:
